# Thunder

Thunder is a lightning talk scheduler designed to make it easy to
recommend and volunteer for talks

## Running the App

We recommend you use `shotgun` to run the app locally
```
  shotgun
```

This serves the application on localhost at port 9393. You can visit it at
http://localhost:9393/

Shotgun also re-loads the application every time we change a file, so it is
always up to date.
